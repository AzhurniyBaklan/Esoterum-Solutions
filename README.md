# Esoterum-Solutions
Small Mindustry Java mod that adds a binary logic system that nobody is going to use.

~~Basically a discount version of Anuke's old bytelogic~~

Thanks [Glenn](https://github.com/GlennFolker) for setting me off on my journey into eternal pain and suffering through Java modding!

# Building
1. Install JDK 16
2. Run `gradlew jar` (or `./gradlew` on Linux/Mac)
3. Mod jar will be in `build/libs`, not compatible with Android
